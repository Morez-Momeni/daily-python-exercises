# Problem 16: Find the First Non‑Repeated Character in a String

## Problem
Write a function that takes a string and returns the **first** character that appears only once (non-repeated). If no such character exists, return `None`.

**Examples:**
- `"swiss"` → `'w'`
- `"hello"` → `'h'`
- `"aabbcc"` → `None`
- `"teeter"` → `'r'`
- `"a"` → `'a'`
- `""` → `None`

## My Solution (Final Version)

I implemented a straightforward linear scan

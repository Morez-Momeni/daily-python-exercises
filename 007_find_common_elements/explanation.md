# Problem 7: Find Common Elements Between Two Lists

## Problem
Write a function that takes two lists and returns a list containing all elements that appear in **both** lists. The order of the result should follow the order of the first list. If an element appears multiple times in the first list and is also present in the second, it should appear multiple times in the result (duplicates are preserved).

**Example:**  
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, []]` and `[1, 8, 7, 6, 5]` → `[1, 5]`

## My Solution

I used nested‑loop to navigate input list and return common elements

# daily-python-exercises

One Python exercise, every day. This repository is a personal log of consistent practice — solving small problems, writing clean code, and documenting the thought process. No perfectionism, just progress.

## Structure

Each problem lives in its own folder, named with a three‑digit index and a short description:

| Folder (example) | Files |
|------------------|-------|
| `001_problem_name/` | `solution.py` , `explanation.md` |

---

## A Note on Continuous Improvement

All solutions in this repository are continuously **reviewed** and enhanced. While each exercise presents a **working solution**, it may not yet handle every edge case or be fully optimized. As I learn more about error handling, performance, and best practices, these solutions will evolve — future versions will address edge cases, add input validation, and refine performance.

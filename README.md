# daily-python-exercises

One Python exercise, every day. This repository is a personal log of consistent practice — solving small problems, writing clean code, and documenting the thought process. No perfectionism, just progress.

## Structure

Each problem lives in its own folder, named with a three‑digit index and a short description:

- `001_find_second_highest/`
  - `solution.py` 
  - `explanation.md`

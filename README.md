One Python exercise, every day. This repository is a personal log of consistent practice — solving small problems, writing clean code, and documenting the thought process. No perfectionism, just progress.

## Structure

Each problem lives in its own folder, named with a three‑digit index and a short description:

001_find_second_highest/
├── solution.py # Final code with comments
├── explanation.md # Approach, complexity, lessons learned

# Project 4: Library Management System 

## Project Overview

A simple, modular library management system built with Python. This project demonstrates:

- Object‑oriented programming with separate classes for Book and User.

- Dictionary‑based storage with auto‑generated IDs.

- A basic CLI menu to add, view, and remove books.

---

## Features 

- **Add books** – Pre‑defined books are added to the library, each receiving a random 10‑character ID.
- **Show books** – Display all books with their IDs and titles.
- **Remove books** – Delete a book by its ID.
- **User management** – User class exists and can be added to the library (but not yet integrated into the menu).

- **Modular design** – Book and User are in separate files for better organisation and reusability.

---
## How to Run
- Place main.py, books.py, and users.py in the same folder.
- Run the main script:

``` python
python main.py

```

**This is simple version** – a working prototype that will be improved over time as I learn more.
